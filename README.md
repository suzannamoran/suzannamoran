### Hi! 

Welcome to my page!

### About Me

I'm in my second year at UNC-Chapel Hill in the B.S. Information Science and B.S. Computer Science programs. I'm very interested in UX/UI design, Human-Computer Interaction, and Information Retrieval. I am passionate about early computer science education and the accessibility of STEM fields to women and other historically underrepresented groups.

### Current Projects

🌐 Deploying Beautiful Soup and Google Drive API to create a Python program on Google Colab that web scrapes the HackNC DevPost to extract pertinent information from 200+ projects and match judges in related fields to maximize efficiency and relevance of evaluators at one of NC's largest hackathons

👩‍💻 Continually adding new tools and softwares to my technological skillset within UNC Computer Science + Social Good's Education team, leading to a social good project next semester

🕸 Implementing JavaScript server-side and client-side scripting on my personal portolio

### Thanks for stopping by!
